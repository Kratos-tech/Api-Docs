# Webhook API Documentation for Merchant Notifications

## Overview

This document outlines the webhook API for notifying merchants about the status of their transactions on the payments platform. Webhooks allow real-time updates to be sent to the merchant's specified endpoint as events occur in the system.

## Endpoint

Merchants should provide a POST endpoint URL where they wish to receive webhook notifications.

## Headers

The following headers will be included in all webhook POST requests:


Content-Type: application/json


## Events

The following events are supported:

1. PAYIN_SUCCESS
2. PAYIN_FAILED
3. PAYIN_EXPIRED
4. PAYOUT_FAILED
5. PAYOUT_SUCCESSFUL

## Payload Structure

All webhook payloads will follow this general structure:

```json
{
  "event": "[EVENT_NAME]",
  "timestamp": "[ISO8601 timestamp]",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

## Handling Webhooks

1. Verify the webhook signature to ensure the payload hasn't been tampered with.
2. Process the event based on the event field in the payload.
3. Use the data in the data object to update your systems accordingly.
4. Respond with a 200 OK status code to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.

## Best Practices

1. Implement retry logic in case your endpoint is temporarily unavailable.
2. Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeout issues.
3. Store the raw webhook payload for debugging and audit purposes.
4. Implement idempotency checks to handle potential duplicate webhook deliveries.

## Testing

A sandbox environment is available for testing webhook integrations. Contact support for access and mock event generation.
